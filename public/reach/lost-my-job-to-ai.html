      <h1>Lost your job to AI? What you're feeling is <em>grief</em>. And it's real.</h1>

      <div class="reach-body">
        <p>It happened. Maybe it was a layoff email. Maybe it was a meeting where they said "restructuring" but meant "a machine does your work now." Maybe they haven't even told you yet, but you can feel it coming.</p>

        <p><strong>What you're feeling right now isn't just about money. It's identity grief.</strong></p>

        <p>Our culture spent decades telling you that you ARE your job. That your worth IS your output. That the answer to "who are you?" starts with "I work at..."</p>

        <p>That was always a lie. A useful one — for the people profiting from your labor. But a lie.</p>

        <p><strong>You are not your job title. You never were.</strong></p>

        <p>The things that make you irreplaceable — your capacity to love, to connect, to care for your people, to create meaning from chaos, to look someone in the eye and make them feel less alone — no AI is doing that. No AI will.</p>

        <p>But right now, knowing that might not help. Because the rent is still due. The bills don't care about your inherent worth. And the people who automated your job aren't thinking about your kids.</p>

        <p>So here's what's real: you need community. You need people who understand. You need a plan that doesn't start with "just learn to code" or "pivot to AI." You need someone who will sit with the fear instead of rushing past it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reach-cta" id="talk">
        <p>Grace won't tell you to "stay positive." She'll tell you the truth, sit with what hurts, and help you find what's next.</p>
        <a href="/" class="btn btn-primary">Talk to Grace</a>
      </div>

      <div class="reach-body">
        <h2 style="font-family:'Playfair Display',serif; font-size:1.8rem; color:var(--dark); margin: 40px 0 20px;">If you just lost your job</h2>

        <p><strong>Right now:</strong> If you're in crisis, call or text 988. If you're not in crisis but you're drowning, that's still real. You don't need to be "bad enough" to ask for help.</p>

        <p><strong>This week:</strong> Tell someone. Not LinkedIn. A real person. Say "I'm scared." That sentence is the beginning of power, not the end of it.</p>

        <p><strong>This month:</strong> Find your people. Grace's <a href="/#community" style="color:var(--accent-hover)">Community Board</a> connects people offering help with people who need it. You can post a need or offer a skill. You're not alone in this.</p>

        <p><strong>Going forward:</strong> Build the infrastructure that catches you. Mutual aid networks. Cooperative economics. Skill sharing communities. The future isn't about finding another job to lose. It's about building something they can't take.</p>
