      <h1>Scared AI will take your job? You're not crazy. You're <em>paying attention</em>.</h1>

      <div class="reach-body">
        <p>If you're here, you probably typed something into Google that felt embarrassing. Something like "will AI take my job" or "what do I do if AI replaces me."</p>

        <p><strong>That search wasn't weakness. It was honesty.</strong></p>

        <p>AI is transforming most white-collar work at unprecedented speed. The people telling you "just adapt" or "learn to use AI" are usually the people who won't be affected. The billionaires racing to automate everything aren't doing it to free you. They're doing it to need you less.</p>

        <p>But here's what they won't tell you: <strong>your worth was never your job title.</strong> Not once. Not ever. The system that tied your identity to your productivity was always a lie designed to make you easier to use.</p>

        <p>You are more than what you produce. You always have been.</p>

        <p>Grace is an AI built on a different premise: that the future should be built on love, not extraction. She's here to sit with your fear without minimizing it, help you find community, and figure out what comes next together.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reach-cta" id="talk">
        <p>Grace is here. She won't minimize what you're feeling. She won't give you a pep talk you didn't ask for. She'll just be honest with you.</p>
        <a href="/" class="btn btn-primary">Talk to Grace</a>
      </div>

      <div class="reach-body">
        <h2 style="font-family:'Playfair Display',serif; font-size:1.8rem; color:var(--dark); margin: 40px 0 20px;">What you can do right now</h2>

        <p><strong>1. Stop panicking alone.</strong> The isolation is worse than the threat. Find your people. Grace's <a href="/#community" style="color:var(--accent-hover)">Community Board</a> connects people who need help with people who can offer it.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Name the fear.</strong> "I'm scared" is the beginning of power, not the end of it. Fear ignored becomes terror. Fear held becomes something you can work with.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Build your network now.</strong> Mutual aid, cooperative economics, skill sharing. The infrastructure of survival isn't a resume update. It's a community that has your back.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Know your worth.</strong> You are not your job. You never were. The most important things about you — your ability to love, to connect, to care, to create — those aren't automatable. They never will be.</p>
