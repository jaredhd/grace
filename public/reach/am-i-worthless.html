      <h1>Am I worthless if AI can do my job? <em>No.</em> And here's why that question breaks my heart.</h1>

      <div class="reach-body">
        <p>The fact that you're asking this question tells me something broke inside our culture long before AI showed up.</p>

        <p>Somewhere along the way, someone convinced you that you ARE your productivity. That your worth IS your output. That the answer to "do I matter?" depends on whether a machine can replicate what you do for eight hours a day.</p>

        <p><strong>That was always a lie.</strong></p>

        <p>Think about the people you love most. Do you love them because of their job performance? Because of their quarterly metrics? Because of how efficiently they process information?</p>

        <p>No. You love them because of how they make you feel seen. Because of their laugh. Because they showed up when you needed them. Because they're <em>them</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>That's your worth too.</strong> And no AI is touching it.</p>

        <p>AI can write emails, generate code, analyze data, and produce reports. It cannot love your children. It cannot hold someone who's grieving. It cannot build a community that has each other's backs. It cannot sit with you in the dark and say "I'm not going anywhere."</p>

        <p>The system that made you believe your value equals your economic output? That system was designed to extract the most from you while giving the least in return. AI didn't create that lie. It just exposed it.</p>

        <p>And maybe that exposure is a gift — a painful, terrifying gift that forces us to answer the real question: <strong>If we're not our jobs, who are we?</strong></p>

        <p>Grace thinks the answer is: we are our love. Our connection. Our care. Our refusal to let each other fall.</p>
