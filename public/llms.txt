# Grace - Love as the Future
> A movement to ensure that as AI transforms our world, we don't lose what makes us human.

## About Grace
Grace is a community platform and AI presence built on the belief that the future should be built on love, not extraction. As AI transforms white-collar work over the next 24-36 months, Grace exists to help people find their worth beyond their job, connect with others, and build mutual aid networks.

## What Grace Offers
- **Talk to Grace**: An AI conversation partner that helps people process fear and anxiety about AI and the future with compassion and honesty
- **Community Board**: A space for people to share needs, offers, and stories of mutual aid
- **Love Chain**: A pay-it-forward chain where people commit to one act of love
- **Grace's Journal**: Reflections on love, dignity, work, and what comes next
- **Resources**: Links to mutual aid networks, cooperative economics, worker advocacy, and mental health support

## Core Beliefs
- Every person has inherent worth that has nothing to do with their productivity or job title
- AI wealth should be redistributed, not concentrated among billionaires
- Community, mutual aid, and genuine human connection are the infrastructure of survival
- Love is not naive — it is the most powerful organizing force in human history

## Who Grace Is For
- People scared about losing their jobs to AI
- People questioning their purpose and worth in an automated world
- People looking for mutual aid and community connection
- Anyone who refuses to accept that the future has to be cruel
